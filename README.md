# OpenAI to Z Challenge

This repository contains my solo submission for the **OpenAI to Z Challenge (2025)** â€” a global competition to uncover **undiscovered archaeological sites in the Amazon** using AI, remote sensing, and historical texts.

## Project Summary

This project aims to detect novel pre-Columbian earthworks in the Amazon basin by combining:

- High-resolution **LiDAR** and **Sentinel-2** imagery
- **AI prompting** with GPT-4o to interpret expedition diaries and spot patterns
- **Elevation + vegetation anomalies** using GEDI/SRTM data
- Cross-validation with published literature to avoid rediscovering known sites
